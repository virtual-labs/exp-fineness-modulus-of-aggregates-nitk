#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :   <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects, which develops intuition, and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

2.| Student will be able to explain grading of the given aggregate for economical mix | Click on the button to display grading of the given aggregate for economical mix | Q1) The Grading curve is a curve having <br>A. % finer passing on X-axis and Sieve size on Y-axis <br> B.  Sieve size on X-axis and cumulative % finer passing on Y-axis <br>C. Sieve size on X-axis and % finer passing on Y-axis <br>D. <u>Sieve size on X-axis and cumulative % finer retained on Y-axis</u> |
3.| Student will be able to calculate the values of Uniformity coefficient (Cu) and Curvature coefficient (Cc) | Enter the values in the Input text box provided and check the result | Q1) The higher is the Fineness Modulus of aggregate, then <br>A. <u>Coarser is the aggregate</u> <br> B. Finer is the aggregate <br> C. Coarser or finer the aggregate <br> D. None of the above <br><br> Q2) Assertion: Faster will be development of strength if finer cement is used. <br> Reason: Finer cement offers greater surface area for hydration <br>A. <u>Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.</u> <br> B. Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A. <br> C. A is true but R is false <br> D. A is false but R is true |

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then click on next button | Display objective and apparatus used | Recall the experiment
2.| Select either of the aggregates displayed, click on fine aggregate then click on next button | Display choose the type of aggregate | To provide basic environment to start the experiment
3.| Click on ON button to start weighing then click on the tray to take the initial weight then tare it to set it to zero, then add the selected sand and weigh it, click on next button | Display take fine aggregate in a pan and measure it to 1kg using the weighing balance | To observe the weights of the material used in the experiment
4.| Click on each tray containing weighed material in order to arrange the sieves then click on the tray containing weighed sand, click on the lid to close it, click on the next button to proceed | Display arrange the sieves in the decreasing order of their size and place the pan at the bottom and then add weighed quantity of fine aggregate to the top most sieve and close the lid | To obtain the grading of the aggregate
